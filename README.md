# Plane_or_stairs_predictor
In this project I used machine learning tools in order to predict whether a record is of walking on flat plane, or on sloped plane or going up stairs. The records contains signals of accelerometer, gyroscope, pressure and temperature. 

main - This is the main code, you can run it on the file that contains the records and you will automatically get the features, the model and model evaluations.
load_data - This code loads the records and prepares it to be ready to use in order to extract features out of it.
Extract_Features - gets the record's vectors for every sample (accelerometer, guroscop, pressure, temperature) and calculates features.
